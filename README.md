# Project "Inventory Management System"

## Description
The project is still incomplete but has a bit of responsiveness and does have CRUD operations working. After completing the **Prerequisites**, **Installation**, **Configuration**, and **Migration**, you can use the signup function on the login page to gain access to the dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: A cross-platform framework for building modern cloud-based web applications.
- **Entity Framework Core**: An object-relational mapper (ORM) for .NET that simplifies data access.
- **MySQL**: A popular open-source relational database management system.
- **ASP.NET Core Identity**: A membership system that adds login functionality to your application.
- **Razor Pages and MVC**: Frameworks for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **JavaScript**: Used for frontend logic, particularly for API fetch operations.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **jQuery and AJAX**: jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation. It also provides powerful **AJAX** capabilities for making asynchronous HTTP requests to fetch or send data without refreshing the page.


## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later
- [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
- [Entity Framework Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet) (if not installed globally)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectname.git
   cd projectname
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   - Run the following command to restore the required .NET and NuGet packages:
     ```bash
     dotnet restore
     ```

3. (Optional) If there's a need to install frontend dependencies (like for `wwwroot/js`):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

### Database Configuration

The project is using MySQL. You'll need to reconfigure the MySQL database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file.

#### Example for MySQL:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server_name;Database=your_db_name;User=your_username;Password=your_password;"
}
```

### Migrations

#### In Visual Studio (using Package Manager Console)

1. Open the **Package Manager Console** (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console).
2. Run the following commands to manage migrations and update the database:

   - To add a new migration:
     ```powershell
     Add-Migration MigrationName
     ```

   - To update the database:
     ```powershell
     Update-Database
     ```

#### In Visual Studio Code (using CLI)

1. Open a terminal in **VS Code** or your preferred command-line tool.
2. Run the following commands to manage migrations and update the database:

   - To add a new migration:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName
     ```

   - To update the database:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

## Running the Project

### In Visual Studio Code

1. Open the project folder in **VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

2. Install the recommended extensions for C# development:
   - C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)
   - MySQL-related extensions (if needed for database integration)

3. Start the project:
   - Open the terminal in VS Code and run:
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```

4. Open the application in your browser at `https://localhost:5001` (or the port specified in the launch settings).

### In Visual Studio

1. Open **Visual Studio** and select `Open a project or solution`.

2. Navigate to the folder where the project is located and open the `.csproj` file.

3. Restore the NuGet packages:
   - Visual Studio should automatically restore them, but you can manually trigger it by right-clicking on the solution in the Solution Explorer and selecting `Restore NuGet Packages`.

4. Run the project:
   - Press `F5` to start debugging or `Ctrl + F5` to run without debugging.

5. Open the application in your browser at `https://localhost:5001` (or the port specified in the launch settings).
